# Musical-Notes-Analyzer

The ability to derive the relevant musical information from a live or recorded performance is relatively easy for a trained listener, but highly non-trivial for a learner and computer. For several practical applications, it would be desirable to obtain this information in a quick, error-free, automated fashion. This design accepts as input a digitized waveform representing an acoustical music signal, and attempts to derive the notes from the signal so that a musical score could be produced.

Use this for the list of notes along with frequencies.
